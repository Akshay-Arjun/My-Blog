# Akshay's Cyber Terminal Portfolio

A retro-inspired, interactive terminal portfolio built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Users can explore your profile, projects, blogs, and more through a command-line interface, complete with boot animations, command routing, autocomplete, and a clickable help menu.

## Features

- **Animated Boot Screen**: Simulates a system boot sequence with ASCII art and typewriter effects.
- **Terminal UI**: All navigation and content are accessed via a terminal-like interface.
- **Command Routing**: Type commands like `aboutme`, `blogs`, `projects`, `thoughts`, or `help` to view different sections.
- **Help Menu**: Type `help` or click the help link to see all available commands. Each command (except destructive ones) is clickable.
- **Autocomplete**: Start typing a command and press `Tab` or the right arrow key to autocomplete (e.g., `a` + `Tab` â†’ `aboutme`).
- **Clear/Destroy**: Use `clear` to reset the terminal, or `destroy` to simulate a session wipe and restart.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile.

## Setup
